HOW TO USE THE SIMULATOR:

If the file is compiled as "simulator", then it is run by:

 ./simulator {name of file}

"name of file" is the file with the list of commands, one per line.

for example a commands file could look like this:

11000001
11010010
01100001
00010100
01101000
00010100
11111000
11000111
01011100
00001100

We chose to use a textual represenation of the intructions.
